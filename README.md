# ByteCrypt

**ByteCrypt** is a simple file encryption and decryption tool built with **C#** and **MetroFramework**. It is designed for **Windows** and provides a dark-themed user interface to secure your files with AES encryption.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is in its **early stage**. The app works fine and files won’t be corrupted, but the user interface is still basic and rough.
